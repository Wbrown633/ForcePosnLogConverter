Program Written by: 

William Brown 
Mech Engineering Co-Op Jan - June '17 


NOTE: This program was written in Python 2.7 and will not run , as written, with a Python 3.X interpreter!! 

Libraries Needed: Matplotlib

Purpose: To parse and graph the data log output created by the Proveris UI 

Input: Location of the log directory to be parsed and graphed as a raw path without quotes. 
On this computer this directory is located at 'C:\temp\Proveris\ISL\Logs\~DATE_TO_BE_PARESED_HERE~'. 


Debugging: The program is fairly straightforward and I did my best to write the program in the most readable way I could. Beyond that I tried
to comment anywhere I felt the code didn't speak for itself. In this folder you should also find some unit tests which should be illustrative 
of how the program should operate.

Improvement: 
    - Better/more tests 
    - Testing of the graphing functionality (no unit tests touch the graphing functionality)
    - General cleanup/optimization (I'm an engineer and not really a Python expert, so I'm sure some of the code could be greatly improved.)
    
    
Hope this program can help someone!
